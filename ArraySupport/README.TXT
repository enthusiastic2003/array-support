This is a prototype library for providing support to Arrays.
There isn't much , but i would be adding other features too.

N.B-This library is probably useful only to my classmates.
But if you want to suggest some improvements(or, report bugs), feel free!!
However, please keep in mind that i have just started to 
learn The Java Programing Language, so, the code cold be crappy.
Therefore it could take me some time to make the improvements(or debug it),
but i would certainly do it.
